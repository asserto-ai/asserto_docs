## Usage

Asserto UI helps you design, test, and refine your LLM prompts.

Once your prompts are production-ready, you can integrate them into your system using the Asserto API. This enables your system to dynamically use the prompts at runtime without needing to redeploy your application.

## Authentication

In order to use Asserto AI API you must first create an API KEY.

Head to the project settings page.

Generate a key and make sure to store it in a safe location.
After creation the key is not displayed again.

To authenticate your requests, include the API key in the Authorization HTTP header using the following format:


```bash
curl -H "Authorization: ApiKey <YOUR_API_KEY>" https://app.asserto.ai/api/prompts
```
