This diagram provides a quick visual reference for the architecture of LLM prompts in your project. It helps teams understand how prompts are organized and processed, debug or optimize prompt flows, and communicate architecture clearly across teams.

<Info>
Nodes in the diagram are automatically created for each prompt registered in your project. You don’t need to define nodes manually — they reflect your prompt configuration.
The positioning of nodes and connections between them need to be arranged manually to represent the flow or logic you want to illustrate.

In addition to the architecture, the diagram displays accuracy and metrics based on testing and evaluations. This gives you a quick overview of the reliability of your system, helping you identify strengths and areas for improvement at a glance.
